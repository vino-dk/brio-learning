# Brio-learning

Nowadays, neural networks are very useful and find applications in a lot of fields. While Artificial Intelligence often refer to [AlphaGo](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo) or chess solving algorithms (for instance [Stockfish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockfish_(chess))), it can also be used in less challenging problems.

The Brio-learning project was conducted with the help of DTU Elektro: the lab is equiped with a machine capable of solving a [Brio labyrinth](http://www.brio.us/products/by-age/6-years-and-up/labyrinth) in real-time. In this project, thanks to neural networks, we try to locate the ball present in the labyrinth.

Project conducted by Tobias Mouritzen, Vinojan Iruthayam, Avi SZYCHTER.
